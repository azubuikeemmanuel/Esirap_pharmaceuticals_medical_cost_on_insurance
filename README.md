# Objective 

The aim of this analysis was to ascertain the major contributors to the peaked insurasnce cost and total medical charges spent by Esirap Pharmaceuticals, this was done by making use of various metrics some of which where: the age group of the insurred peronnel and their smoking status, the gender of insurred personnel, medical charges by region etc.


# Data source

- What where the datasets needed to conduct this project?

To conduct this analysis the record of the health and demographic data of each individual insured by esirap pharmaceuticals, some of which were:W

- The age of the insured individuals
- The gender
- The Body Mass Index (BMI): A value derived from the height and weight of an individual, indicating whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese.
- The number of children covered in the insurance plan.
- The smoking status: Whether the insurred individual is a smoker or non-smoker.
- The region the individuals resides.
- The medical charges billed to each insurred individual.

- Where was the dataset sourced from?

This dataset was provided by the internship programme which I undertook. You can make refrence to it on my Github documents file(documents/Esirap pharmaceuticals (dataset).csv).

# Design

First off we need to understand the metrics we are using to analyse this datasets and what the results of the analysis should depict. This analysis was conducted to answer the questions:

- What is the distribution of medical charges across different age groups?
- How does smoking affect medical charges?
- What is the relationship between BMI and medical charges?
- What regions have the highest average medical charges?
- How do medical charges vary by gender?
- Is there a correlation between the number of children and medical charges?
- What is the distribution of BMI across different regions?
- How does age and smoking status combined affect medical charges?

The dashboard design consisted of:

- Bar charts
- Horizontal bar charts
- Pie charts
- insights and recommendation notes
- Region and gender filters.

# Data cleaning 

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data met the following criteria and constraints:

- Only relevant columns were retained.
- All data types were appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column contained null values, indicating complete data for all records.

# Visualisation

How where the charts prepared?

Excel pivot table was used to create the following charts:
